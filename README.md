Investment time/hacking sessions held every month at [Nimble](https://nimblehq.co) üôå

## Introduction

Started in November 2016, Nimble Growth is an event held every month allowing our team to:

* Research new technologies or even new stacks
* Improve our internal processes e.g. automating manual processes, decrease the time to start building a new application, 
speeding up our CI/CD pipelines.
* Work on non-client projects
* Have fun! üï∫ üíÉ

Each session lasts 1.5 days starting from Thursday mid-day until the following Friday (whole day). Our previous effort, 
called Tech Wednesdays, had a shorter duration of 0.5 day which was too short. Strong of this experience we decided to 
provide a larger block of time to achieve greater things.

This event is for all teammates to join: devs, PMs and designers!

At the end of the session, we gather for a show and tell time! Each team or individual prepared a presentation to share 
their achievements, struggles and what they have learnt. The repository contains all presentations for all sessions.

## How we do it

![timeline](assets/timeline.png)

* Each project is validated **two weeks before** the session actually starts. This allows to perform research on topics 
and feasibility.  
* Once approved, each team/individual has an additional **two weeks to prepare** for the session. Additional research and 
planning are encouraged so that everyone can hit the ground running as soon as the session starts üèÉ‚Äç. 
* Once a session has started, all code is pushed to public repositories on Github. 
* At the end of the first half day, teams are encouraged to start working on their presentation to save precious time on the second day. 
* The session wraps on Friday at 5 pm at which point we all gather to see the presentations of our teammates. 
* Each project has a ten-minute presentation time.

* We use a Trello board to manage topics and projects. 
* The board is not only a repository of ideas for future topics or projects, but also where we manage the status of projects 
e.g. Approved, Backlog (ready to go), In Progress, Done.
